## Assumptions

The following assumptions made in the development process:
1. Used [Angular Material]([https://github.com/angular/angular-cli](https://material.angular.io/components/categories))
2. Created FileModel class to represent each file from the server response
3. Created input component to get user search input
4. Created tree-view component to display search results
5. Created Cache service to save results by prefixes entered by the user and also use it to comunicate between the 2 components created above
6. Created Data service for getting results from the server (assummed running from: http://localhost:8080 - can be changed on environment.ts file)

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
